      // ! as default using the const keyword recommended. Because changeable values can occurs some bugs and problems. That's why you must use const statements as much as possible.

      // ? So, usually use const but if you are sure there is a variable must be changed later.

      // todo var keyword is pretty much same as "let" keyword, var is a deprecated keyword that used in the past, it is not being used anymore. We must use let and const intead.

      // ! in javascript we don't have to use variable keywords exactly. we can write a variable without declaring it. But never write only variable itself without really declairing it.
