      // * using strict mode like above avoids us to miss errors. By using strict mode we can easily realize our errors and fix them.
      // ! 'use strict'; must be written top of the document because strict mode activation starts from the line which strict mode is written

      if (hasDriverLicence) console.log("he can drive");

      // * strict mode also warns us about using reserved words as a variable because it's forbidden in javascript

    //   const switch = 18; // ! this code written incorrect deliberately
