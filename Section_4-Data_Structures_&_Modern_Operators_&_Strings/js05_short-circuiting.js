Because remember if we use OR operator then a truthy value is enough to make this condition above returns "true" , so if contion is true it means whole condition is "true". That's why Or (||) operator only returns truthy values because one true value makes all condition true. But if there isn't any truthy value then it returns the last falsy value.

        console.log( 0 || "second value" || 0 ||"third value"|| -0);

        console.log("murat" && "ahmet" && 0 && 25 && undefined );
        // if we use and operator in this way. This operator returns the first falsy value's itself. Because remember when we use and operator, we know that if all conditions are true then this expression above returns "true", otherwise it will return "false".  Because if one of them is false then expression returns false no matter how many truthy values are there.

        // In short circuiting process OR (||) operator returns the  first truthy value, if all values are falsy in expression, then it will return the last falsy value in the expression. So, you know that this expression result is whether true  or false finally.
